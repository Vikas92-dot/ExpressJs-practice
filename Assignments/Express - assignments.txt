1. Design a server to respond to following routes
	localhost:3000/ admin / home
	localhost:3000/ admin / about
    localhost:3000/ admin / contact

	localhost:3000/ user / home
    localhost:3000/ user / about
    localhost:3000/ user / contact

	define static files in the public folder and call them using view engine - ejs

2. Design responses for 3 router defined as AdminRouter, StudentRouter, FacultyRouter as following

data = 
[
 {id: 1, "sname":"vinod" , "age" : 20, "stream" :"cs" , "sem": "VI", "coding level" : "intermediatary"}, 
 {id: 2, "sname":"Akshay" , "age" : 20, "stream" :"cs" , "sem": "VI", "coding level" : "Beginner"}
 {id: 3, "sname":"Rithvik" , "age" : 20, "stream" :"IT" , "sem": "VI", "coding level" : "Expert"}
] 

a. AdminRouter
